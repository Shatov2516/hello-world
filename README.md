# hello-world

Just a simple test

Hi, Shatov here, there is not so much to talk about me rn, i'm just a simple person trying to learn some stuff about coding in general, but currently i find myself just leaning the basics of linux CL, so yeah real beginner talking here. And i think there is not much more to add, so thanks for tha atenttion (if there is anyone really reading this).
